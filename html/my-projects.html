          One of the most exciting projects that I've worked on is a clone of Airbnb called "Heirbnb," which is styled
          as a vacation rental site for heirs and heiresses. This project was built using a range of technologies,
          including JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize.

          The project allowed me to put my skills to the test and create a real-world application from scratch. I worked
          on both the frontend and backend, developing features such as user authentication, property listings, booking
          management, and review management. In addition, I styled the website to fit the theme of "HeirBnB,"
          incorporating luxury elements like royal purples, and every image is of a luxury home.

          Overall, this project was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to gain a deeper
          understanding of web development. It taught me how to work with complex technologies and build scalable
          applications that can handle a large amount of traffic. I am proud of what I accomplished with "HeirBnB," and
          I look forward to using the skills I gained from this project to build even more exciting projects in the
          future.

          <h2>Handmade Haven</h2>

          I worked on an exciting project with three other people, a clone of Etsy. This project was built using Flask,
          SQLAlchemy,
          Python, React, and Redux. It was an incredible opportunity for me to collaborate with other developers and
          create a real-world application.

          During the project, my primary focus was on developing the shopping cart feature. I wanted to create a
          seamless experience for users to add items to their cart, manage their items, and check out. I worked
          tirelessly to ensure that the shopping cart feature was efficient, user-friendly, and secure.

          Throughout the development process, I faced several challenges that pushed me outside of my comfort zone.
          However, working collaboratively with my team, we were able to overcome any obstacles that came our way. The
          result was a fully functional and beautifully designed application that mimicked the features and
          functionalities of Etsy.

          Overall, working on this project was an incredible learning experience for me. It allowed me to hone my skills
          in Flask, Python, React, and Redux while also learning how to collaborate with other developers on a
          large-scale project. I am proud of the work that we accomplished and am excited to continue working with a
          team in the future.

          <h2>Gracefully Baked</h2>
          <p>My capstone solo project, built with Flask, Python, React, and Redux</p>
          <a href="https://gracefully-baked.onrender.com">Live Site</a>

          From my first day at App Academy, I knew that I wanted to build a custom-designed e-commerce site where my
          friends and family could order my delicious baked goods. I decided to name the site "Gracefully Baked" to
          capture my passion for both baking and web development.

          To achieve my goal, I used a range of technologies, including Flask, SQLAlchemy, Python, React, and Redux. I
          made sure to include essential features such as product management and creation, review management, a search
          feature, a shopping cart, and a user profile page. The site's design was meant to showcase my baked goods with
          high-quality images and clear product descriptions.

          Building Gracefully Baked was an incredibly rewarding experience for me. It allowed me to combine my love of
          baking with my passion for web development and hone my skills in Flask, SQLAlchemy, Python, React, and Redux.
          I am proud of what I have accomplished, and I look forward to continuing to work on this site and add more
          features to it, and will hopefully launch it for public use one day.
